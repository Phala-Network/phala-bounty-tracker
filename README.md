# Tracker for Phala Bounty Projects

This repository contains all the technical details about Phala's bounty projects.
It records all the interaction between the project developers and the curators and is meant to help our community members and the Council to understand and track the progress of Phala improvements.

## What is Phala Bounty

The [Phala Treasury](https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/docs/governance/4-treasury/) collects its funds mainly from transaction fees, slashing, and Secure Worker mining commission (20%). The Treasury is ultimately controlled by the [Council](https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/docs/governance/2-join-the-council/) and is used for the benefit of the Phala ecosystem.

For now, there are two kinds of Treasury spending: the *Tip* for minor contributions like a bug fix, code optimization, and document improvement, and the *Bounty* for more serious contributions like extending the capabilities of the Phala network.

To apply for the Phala Bounty, refer to our [tutorial](https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/docs/governance/4-treasury/#creating-a-bounty-proposal) and create the Bounty Proposal through the on-chain Governance module.
