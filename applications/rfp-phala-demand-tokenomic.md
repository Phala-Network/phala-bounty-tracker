# RFP: Phala Network Demand-End Tokenomic Design

Phala Network is a decentralized protocol that aggregates the distributed computing resources and make it available for developer to use. The tokenomic plays the core role in this process. On the one hand, the miners (resource contributors) are rewarded by the contribution. On the other hand, the developers pay the protocol in exchange for the resources. Khala Network is already running with a miner subsidy mechanism. Therefore a pricing mechanism is important to us.

This RFP is to ask for a demand-end tokenmoic design that should cover:

- The general pricing model for the computation resources in Phala Network
- Write the tokenomic whitepaper
- Guide the development team to implement the tokenomic

The suggested milestones:

- Complete the first version of the demand-end tokenomic design
- Publish the full tokenomic whitepaper
- Work with the dev team to implement the tokenomic, propose as a Khala runtime upgrade, and get passed
- Run the tokenomic on Khala for 3 months, and then improve based on the feedback, and launch it on Phala Network
