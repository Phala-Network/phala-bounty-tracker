## Short description:


## Context of the bounty:

any points discussed in advance in any channel related to the bounty proposal and background research for your project. 
background of the proponent, team credentials. 
their motivation (including any conflict of interests or association to any governing bodies)
any known backups already behind the solution (known token holders, organizations or collectives building on Kusama Network or participating in its governance mechanism in any way).

## Problem statement: what problem is this proposal trying to solve? If no problems are being solved, which topics does the bounty cover? Make it as granular as possible to allow token holders to understand the logic behind it. 

## Proposal Objective/solution/s to point 2: What is the goal of the bounty? What does 'success' look like?  Explain what your solution is, after taking into consideration the context and the problem. Make sure to consider all points included in the problem statement to ensure a complete and balanced proposal, and try to be as granular as possible. 
  
  a) How does this proposal change the current logic in Khala? If the proposal's goal is to change the way any of the elements of the network work, compare the current state in Khala and how this proposal could change token holders' experience if approved by the Council. Alternatively, if the execution has already taken place and you are using this proposal to receive funds from the Treasury as payment for a delivered task, compare past and present logic and how this proposal has enhanced the network experience.

  b) Who does this solution help? Specify which stakeholder will benefit or is being benefited at the moment by the solution, if any.

  c) Milestones and tasks to include: Please provide a list of milestone deliverables. This list should closely reflect the list of deliverables agreed by your team to reach the solution, along with resources needed for development and timelines. If your project includes any technical development, each item in the list should include a link to the deliverable itself:
